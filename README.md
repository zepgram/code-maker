- Generator issue:
Resolve xml merge
Add basic front source model selection for core_config
Make correct implementation of controllers with interface

---

- Generator add configurator with a ".maker" file:
one shot, then must be updated with CLI - set current project: set project path + user name + user email + declare strict types
one shot, then must be updated with CLI - assign module
- Generator with magento versioning with a "x.y.z.json" file:
declare and load config re-usable with a class

---

- Generator to make:
Create webapi.xml for rest/soap service
Create form ui component

---

- Generator to improve (but hard to do or need refactoring):
Allow option selection based on field type in getOptions (this will let us the ability to set extra parameters for db_schema.xml)
Plugin with read from existing method (add parameters etc...)
Injection logger
